## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
##1. Introduction
(a) What is your overarching story?
#While looking up datasets I found that spotify came up a lot. I use spotify quite frequently so I used this website 
#called Exportify and gathered up my top songs from 2020 & 2021 to use for data analysis
(b) What are some interesting questions that you believe you can answer with the
data set you selected?
#Some interesting questions I believe I can answer within is does my music taste change within 1 year and if so how? 
#Who are my top artists and how frequently do they show up? Popularity? 

c) What elements of the data set do you need to explain to ensure the reader
understands how it can answer your research question(s)
#Some elements of the dataset that should be explain prior is that this is my personal 
#playlist and what is shown here is not an overall top songs directly from spotify 
(d) State your research question(s) and hypotheses (the expected answer to your
question)
#within is does my music taste change within 1 year and if so how? 
#Who are my top artists and how frequently do they show up? Popularity?

##2. Methods
(a) Begin with a description of the data set
i. How was this data collected originally (if you know) and how did you go
about finding and gaining access to the data set?
##The Data was collected from a develops used website called Exportify 
##I had to allow access to my personal spotify account to create a csv file 
ii. What variables does it contain? (variable type)
(b) You can / should include you initial visual exploration of the data set
i. Draw the distributions of your variables using the correct visualization (his-
tograms, box plots)
##Variables it contains is Artist Name, Popularity, Album Name, Track Duration 






##3. Results
(a) Here is where you will generate most of your R code to visualize specific effects
in your data and conduct the proper analyses.
(b) Explain, using your own words, the analyses you have conducted in R and the
results you have obtained.
(c) Create visualizations that support your analyses.


##Lets Determine my top artists for 2020 & 2021
```{r}

    arrange(desc(Popularity))


ggplot(top_artists, aes(x = Artist.Name.s., y = Popularity)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",  fill = "blue", width = 0.6 ) + 
    labs(title = "Top Artists of 2020", x = "Artists", y = "Popularity (Angela's Top Songs 2020)") +

#Top Artists of 2021

```{r}

ggplot(top_artists, aes(x = Artist.Name.s., y = Popularity)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",  fill = "orange", width = 0.6 ) + #geom_bar() makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group

    coord_flip()#coord_flip. Creates Cartesian coordinates with x and y flipped and then convert them with ggplotly

##4. Discussion
(a) What are the conclusions that you draw from your analyses?
##Conclusions I made from this analysis is that over one year time a music artits can change
##By linking popularity to the artist proves how influence can affect ones music taste as they can
##Hear them more frequently thus adding it to their playlist.
(b) How do these conclusions answer your research questions?
#These conclusions help answer my research questions in a visual manner showing how frequently 
##One artist shows up and how that can add to them becoming my top artist for 2020 & 2021
(c) How do these conclusion affect the topic on a larger scale?
i. What should the reader take home from your analysis of the data set you
selected?
##The reader should take home from my analysis is that you can learn a lot about yourself 
##within doing research regarding your own taste. By doing this it helps me understand 
#How & why a song is popular and how it ending up on my playlist.
